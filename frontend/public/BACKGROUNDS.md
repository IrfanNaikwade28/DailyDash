# Background Images for Theme Switcher

This folder should contain three background images for the theme switcher:

## Required Files:
- `bg1.jpg` - Ocean Breeze theme (Cool blue tones)
- `bg2.jpg` - Sunset Glow theme (Warm colors)
- `bg3.jpg` - Night Sky theme (Deep purples and dark)

## Recommendations:
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 or higher for best quality
- **Format**: JPEG for smaller file size, or PNG for higher quality
- **File Size**: Keep under 500KB each for optimal performance
- **Style**: Choose images that work well with glassmorphism UI (good contrast, not too busy)
